# js-config-gen

Inspired by [@petehunt's](https://github.com/petehunt) [rwb](https://github.com/petehunt/rwb).

My personal node module for scaffolding application using JavaScript. Primarily
for scaffolding projects using React, Babel, Eslint, Karma and Mocha. Also
serves as a way to shared configurations between projects I work on.

Generated static configs are available in `dist`, if you prefer to use a config
as a base and do some heavy customizations or want to see what they are.
